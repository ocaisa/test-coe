SUMMARY:NOMAD&#039\;s Midsummer School: Towards exascale solutions in Green
  function methods and advanced DFT
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1325
DESCRIPTION:<p>With 10^18 floating point operations per second\, exascale 
 computers will be able to simulate and analyze complex processes in real 
 materials more realistically than what is possible today. This will allow 
 to study systems of higher complexity (in space and time) and to achieve 
 higher accuracy and precision. In close contact with academia and 
 industry\, the <strong>NOMAD CoE</strong> will develop exascale software\,
  artificial intelligence (Al) methods\, and efficient workflows for an 
 advanced materials modeling. The <strong>NOMAD School focusses on 
 "exascale solutions in Green function methods and advanced 
 DFT"</strong>.</p> <p> The NOMAD School features <strong>50-minute 
 tutorial lectures </strong>by renowned scientists of the field (see below 
 and the PROGRAM) who will introduce their respective topics and address 
 recent exascale achievements and prevailing challenges.</p> <p> NOMAD 
 anticipates that the exascale challenge\, which shows "exaflops" 
 performance in some components of the codes\, will be met by workflows 
 handling high-throughput calculations and/or complex ensemble averages of 
 statistical mechanics and artificial intelligence. To get more practical 
 insights into all these topics\, there will be hands-on tutorials and/or 
 hackathons in the afternoon\, run in parallel by key developers of the 
 codes Abinit\, exciting\, FHI-aims\, <strong>GPAW</strong>\, and by 
 <strong>developers of ASE/ASR\, CC4S and Mini-Apps</strong>. For 
 example:</p> <ul> <li>people presently using code A can learn about the 
 possible advantages of code B.</li> <li>people using any of the codes can 
 learn about and contribute to the workflow management of ASE/AS R.</li> 
 <li>people using any of the codes can learn about and contribute to the 
 development of the INTERFACE towards CC4S (coupled cluster for 
 solids).</li> <li>people using any of the codes can learn about and 
 contribute to the development of mini apps to check and analyze their code
  performance.</li> </ul> <p>The school is aimed at graduate students and 
 early-career postdocs. </p>
