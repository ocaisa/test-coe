SUMMARY:Scientific Visualization with COVISE and Vistle
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/855
DESCRIPTION:<p>This course is targeted at researchers with basic knowledge 
 in numerical simulation\, who would like to learn how to visualize their 
 simulation results on the desktop but also in Augmented Reality and 
 Virtual Environments. The two-day workshop gives a short overview over 
 scientific visualization in general\, followed by a hands-on introduction 
 to 3D desktop visualization with <a 
 href="https://services.excellerat.eu/viewcode/2">VISTLE </a> and <a 
 href="http://www.hlrs.de/covise/">COVISE</a>. Participants will further 
 learn how to build interactive 3D Models for Virtual Environments and how 
 to set up an Augmented Reality visualization.</p>
