SUMMARY:YALES2 Training Session
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1322
DESCRIPTION:<p>YALES2 aims at the solving of two-phase combustion from 
 primary atomization to pollutant prediction on massive complex meshes. It 
 is able to handle efficiently unstructured meshes with several billions of
  elements\, thus enabling the Direct Numerical Simulation and Large-Eddy 
 Simulation of laboratory and semi-industrial configurations. The recent 
 developments are focused on the dynamic mesh adaptation of tetrahedral-
 based massive meshes for fronts and interfaces.</p> <p>This training 
 session targets researchers and engineers interested in learning YALES2 
 and/or the numerical methodologies developed in YALES2: solving for 
 incompressible turbulent flows\, two-phase flows\, dynamic mesh 
 adaptation\, etc.</p> <p>More information about YALES2 can be found 
 <strong><a href="https://www.coria-
 cfd.fr/index.php/YALES2">here</a></strong>.</p>

SUMMARY:Hybrid Programming in HPC – MPI+X
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/920
DESCRIPTION:<p>Most HPC systems are clusters of shared memory nodes. To use
  such systems efficiently both memory consumption and communication time 
 has to be optimized. Therefore\, hybrid programming may combine the 
 distributed memory parallelization on the node interconnect (e.g.\, with 
 MPI) with the shared memory parallelization inside of each node (e.g.\, 
 with OpenMP or MPI-3.0 shared memory). This course analyzes the strengths 
 and weaknesses of several parallel programming models on clusters of SMP 
 nodes. Multi-socket-multi-core systems in highly parallel environments are
  given special consideration. MPI-3.0 has introduced a new shared memory 
 programming interface\, which can be combined with inter-node MPI 
 communication. It can be used for direct neighbor accesses similar to 
 OpenMP or for direct halo copies\, and enables new hybrid programming 
 models. These models are compared with various hybrid MPI+OpenMP 
 approaches and pure MPI. Numerous case studies and micro-benchmarks 
 demonstrate the performance-related aspects of hybrid programming.</p> 
 <p>Hands-on sessions are included on all days. Tools for hybrid 
 programming such as thread/process placement support and performance 
 analysis are presented in a "how-to" section. This course provides 
 scientific training in Computational Science and\, in addition\, the 
 scientific exchange of the participants among themselves.</p> <p>Content

 two-phase reactive flows through tutorials supervised by experts of the 
 code. The AVBP code is a parallel code of fluid mechanics that solves 
 compressible Navier-Stokes equations for laminar and turbulent reactive 
 flows\, in 2D and 3D\, on unstructured and hybrid meshes\, with third 
 order Taylor Galerkin schemes. The resolution of these equations is based 
 on the Large Eddy Simulation (or Large Eddy Simulation) approach. Reduced 
 chemical kinetics according to the Arrhenius law coupled to the TFLES 
 model for sub-grid flame-turbulence interactions make possible to treat 
 combustion phenomena. AVBP can also calculate two-phase flows using a 
 Lagrangian or Eulerian solver. AVBP applies to aeronautical combustion 
 chambers\, turbomachinery\, industrial furnaces and safety issues\, it 
 allows for example to evaluate polluting emissions (CO\, NOx and soot)\, 
 to treat thermo-acoustic instabilities or detonation phenomena. AVBP is a 
 world-famous code in the field of combustion\, used by many laboratories 
 (IMFT in Toulouse\, EM2C in Centralesupelec\, TU Munich\, Von Karmann 
 Institute\, ETH Zurich\, etc.) and in industry (SAFRAN AIRCRAFT ENGINES\, 
 SAFRAN HELICOPTER ENGINES\, ARIANEGROUP\, HERAKLES\, TOTAL\, etc.).</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>C++ is a multi-paradigm programming language supporting 
 procedural\, object-oriented\, generic and functional programming styles. 
 This course will provide a practical introduction to C++\, adhering to the
  latest official language standard at the time of the course.</p> <p>The 
 participants will study small example programs\, each demonstrating a 
 certain aspect of C++\, and then do simple programming exercises using the
  lessons learned from the examples. The initial focus of the course will 
 be to make the participants comfortable utilizing modern C++\, e. g.\, 
 solving small problems using the STL containers and algorithms along with 
 lambda functions. Syntax will be explained in detail when needed. Once the
  participants are familiar and comfortable with the easy-to-use aspects of
  modern C++\, the powerful abstraction mechanisms of the language\, such 
 as classes and class hierarchies\, and templates will be presented at 
 depth. It is hoped that this course will encourage fruitful application of
  the programming language and provide a good foundation for further 
 learning.</p> <p>It is assumed that the participants have previous 
 programming experience in languages such as C\, C++\, Python\, Java and 
 Fortran. This course introduces programming in C++20. It is not meant to

UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1164
DESCRIPTION:<p>Programming languages such as C++ are devices to help you 
 think and plan workflows in a systematic\, logical\, and consistent – say 
 structured – way. C++ contains many language features\, and comprises 
 different paradigms such as precedural or object-oriented programming. As 
 with many other contemporary programming languages\, the difficulties of 
 writing code lie in making design decisions – which language features to 
 use\, and in which way.</p> <p>This 3-days course covers an introduction 
 into the C++ language features (types and data structures\, basic key 
 words\, flow control structures\, templates\, ...)\, some of the paradigm 
 ideas\, software development process including program design\, project 
 managment\, debugging\, and more (cmake\, doxygen\, git\, ...).</p> <p>The
  straightest way to learn a programming language is probably to have the 
 need to apply it to a problem. If you have a specific problem or project 
 in mind\, this would be perfect. However\, we offer Hands-on tutorials 
 with application examples out of the scientific and mathematical fields\, 
 which are usually met in the universitary environment. We want to 
 disburden the entry and access to the skills of programming for 
 prospective and advancing scientists and engineers.</p>

SUMMARY:High-performance scientific computing in C++  (ONLINE)
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/981
DESCRIPTION:<p>Modern C++\, with its support for procedural\, objected 
 oriented\, generic and functional programming styles\, offers many 
 powerful abstraction mechanisms to express complexity at a high level 
 while remaining very efficient. It is therefore the language of choice for
  many scientific projects. The approval of the latest language standard\, 
 C++20\, has also opened up new abstraction layers and new exciting ways to
  organize code at all levels. However\, achieving high performance by 
 today's standards requires understanding and exploiting multiple levels of
  parallelism\, as well as understanding C++ code from a performance 
 centric viewpoint.</p> <p>In this course\, the participants will learn how
  to write C++ programs which better utilize typical HPC hardware resources
  of the present day. The course is geared towards scientists and engineers
  already familiar with C++17\, who wish to develop maintainable and fast 
 applications. Since C++20 is a relatively large structural change of the 
 C++ language\, similar to C++11\, novel ways to write expressive\, 
 maintainable and fast code are now available to C++ programmers\, which 
 will be introduced in the course. The participants will learn techniques 
 to better utilize CPU caches\, instruction pipelines\, SIMD functionality 
 and multi-threading. Shared memory parallel programming on multiple CPU 
 cores will be introduced using standard C++ parallel STL and Intel (R) 
 Threading Building Blocks. The participants will also learn basic GPGPU 
 programming using C++ template based generic programming techniques.</p>

SUMMARY:NOMAD&#039\;s Midsummer School: Towards exascale solutions in Green
  function methods and advanced DFT
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1325
DESCRIPTION:<p>With 10^18 floating point operations per second\, exascale 
 computers will be able to simulate and analyze complex processes in real 
 materials more realistically than what is possible today. This will allow 
 to study systems of higher complexity (in space and time) and to achieve 
 higher accuracy and precision. In close contact with academia and 
 industry\, the <strong>NOMAD CoE</strong> will develop exascale software\,
  artificial intelligence (Al) methods\, and efficient workflows for an 
 advanced materials modeling. The <strong>NOMAD School focusses on 
 "exascale solutions in Green function methods and advanced 
 DFT"</strong>.</p> <p> The NOMAD School features <strong>50-minute 
 tutorial lectures </strong>by renowned scientists of the field (see below 
 and the PROGRAM) who will introduce their respective topics and address 
 recent exascale achievements and prevailing challenges.</p> <p> NOMAD 
 anticipates that the exascale challenge\, which shows "exaflops" 
 performance in some components of the codes\, will be met by workflows 
 handling high-throughput calculations and/or complex ensemble averages of 
 statistical mechanics and artificial intelligence. To get more practical 
 insights into all these topics\, there will be hands-on tutorials and/or 
 hackathons in the afternoon\, run in parallel by key developers of the 
 codes Abinit\, exciting\, FHI-aims\, <strong>GPAW</strong>\, and by 
 <strong>developers of ASE/ASR\, CC4S and Mini-Apps</strong>. For 
 example:</p> <ul> <li>people presently using code A can learn about the 
 possible advantages of code B.</li> <li>people using any of the codes can 
 learn about and contribute to the workflow management of ASE/AS R.</li> 
 <li>people using any of the codes can learn about and contribute to the 
 development of the INTERFACE towards CC4S (coupled cluster for 
 solids).</li> <li>people using any of the codes can learn about and 
 contribute to the development of mini apps to check and analyze their code
  performance.</li> </ul> <p>The school is aimed at graduate students and 
 early-career postdocs. </p>

SUMMARY:Hybrid Programming in HPC - MPI+X
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1165
DESCRIPTION:<p>Most HPC systems are clusters of shared memory nodes. To use
  such systems efficiently both memory consumption and communication time 
 has to be optimized. Therefore\, hybrid programming may combine the 
 distributed memory parallelization on the node interconnect (e.g.\, with 
 MPI) with the shared memory parallelization inside of each node (e.g.\, 
 with OpenMP or MPI-3.0 shared memory). This course analyzes the strengths 
 and weaknesses of several parallel programming models on clusters of SMP 
 nodes. Multi-socket-multi-core systems in highly parallel environments are
  given special consideration. MPI-3.0 has introduced a new shared memory 
 programming interface\, which can be combined with inter-node MPI 
 communication. It can be used for direct neighbor accesses similar to 
 OpenMP or for direct halo copies\, and enables new hybrid programming 
 models. These models are compared with various hybrid MPI+OpenMP 
 approaches and pure MPI. Numerous case studies and micro-benchmarks 
 demonstrate the performance-related aspects of hybrid programming.</p> 
 <p>Hands-on sessions are included on all days. Tools for hybrid 
 programming such as thread/process placement support and performance 
 analysis are presented in a "how-to" section. This course provides 
 scientific training in Computational Science and\, in addition\, the 
 scientific exchange of the participants among themselves.</p> <p>This 
 online course is a PRACE training event. It is organised by LRZ in 
 cooperation with NHR@FAU\, RRZE and the VSC Research Center\, TU Wien.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Since the beginning of the 2010 decade\, the use of graphics
  cards (GPUs) as acceleration devices for certain types of computation has
  grown rapidly and\, while they were initially designed for video games\, 
 their use for scientific computation has grown steadily.<br> Although they

  directives (OpenACC standard and OpenMP standard since its version 4.5)\,
  in the straight line of the usual programming paradigms on scientific 
 computers\, which makes the use of GPUs easily affordable for a large 
 number of programmers.<br> The objective of this training is to present

SUMMARY:Introduction to parallel programming with MPI and OpenMP
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/983
DESCRIPTION:<p>An introduction to the parallel programming of 
 supercomputers is given. The focus is on the usage of the Message Passing 
 Interface (MPI)\, the most often used programming model for systems with 
 distributed memory. Furthermore\, OpenMP will be presented\, which is 
 often used on shared-memory architectures.</p> <p>The first four days of 
 the course consist of lectures and short exercises. A fifth day is devoted
  to demonstrating the use of MPI and OpenMP in a larger context. To this 
 end\, starting from a simple but representative serial algorithm\, a 
 parallel version will be designed and implemented using the techniques 
 presented in the course.</p>

DESCRIPTION:<p>Python is becoming a popular language for scientific 
 applications and is increasingly used for high performance computing. In 
 this course we want to introduce Matlab programmers to the usage of 
 Python. Matlab and Python have a comparable language philosophy\, but 
 Python can offer better performance using its optimizations and 
 parallelization interfaces. Python also increases the portability and 
 flexibility (interaction with other open source and proprietary software 
 packages) of solutions\, and can be run on supercomputing resources 
 without high licensing costs.</p> <p>The training course will be divided 
 into three stages: First\, attendants will learn how to do a direct 
 translation of language concepts from Matlab to Python. Then\, 
 optimization of scripts using more Pythonic data structures and functions 
 will be shown. Finally\, code will be taken to the supercomputers where 
 basic parallel programming (MPI) will be used to exploit parallelism in 
 the computation.</p> <p>The course will focus on numerical and statistical
  analysis as well as on image processing applications.</p> <p>This course 
 involves theoretical and hands on sessions which will be guided by experts
  in Python\, Matlab and High Performance Computing. Attendants are highly 
 encouraged to bring their own Matlab scripts.</p>

SUMMARY:Advanced Parallel Programming with MPI and OpenMP
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/984
DESCRIPTION:<p>The focus is on advanced programming with MPI and OpenMP. 
 The course addresses participants who have already some experience with 
 C/C++ or Fortran and MPI and OpenMP\, the most popular programming models 
 in high performance computing (HPC).</p> <p>The course will teach newest 
 methods in MPI-3.0/3.1 and OpenMP-4.5 and 5.0\, which were developed for 
 the efficient use of current HPC hardware. Topics with MPI are the group 
 and communicator concept\, process topologies\, derived data types\, the 
 new MPI-3.0 Fortran language binding\, one-sided communication and the new
  MPI-3.0 shared memory programming model within MPI. Topics with OpenMP 
 are the OpenMP-4.0 extensions\, as the vectorization directives\, thread 
 affinity and OpenMP places. (The GPU programming with OpenMP-4.0 
 directives is not part of this course.) The course also contains 
 performance and best practice considerations.</p> <p>Hands-on sessions (in
  C and Fortran) will allow users to immediately test and understand the 
 taught constructs of the Message Passing Interface (MPI) and the shared 
 memory directives of OpenMP. Most MPI exercises will (in addition to C and
  Fortran) also be available for Python + mpi4py + numpy.</p> <p>This 
 course provides scientific training in Computational Science\, and in 
 addition\, the scientific exchange of the participants among themselves. 
 It is organized by JSC in cooperation with HLRS. </p>
