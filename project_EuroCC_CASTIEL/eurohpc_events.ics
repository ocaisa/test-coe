SUMMARY:Programming and Data Infrastructure in Digital Humanities
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1311
DESCRIPTION:<p><strong>INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE</strong></p> 
 <strong>Rationale</strong> <p>Programming in Digital Humanities (DH) is 
 one of the most challenging topics in this field of knowledge and 
 research. Unfortunately\, a significant number of DH’ers coming from areas
  of knowledge such as literature\, philology\, history\, etc.\, still 
 experience great difficulties when it comes to use programming languages 
 to handle their data and display it. This meeting aims to address these 
 difficulties and discuss the latest developments associated to programming
  in DHs by bringing together scientists from different areas within the 
 community.</p> <strong>Scientific Topics</strong> <p>The meeting program 
 covers several fundamental topics in the field of programming in Digital 
 Humanities\, e.g.:</p> <ul> <li> Data programming infrastructures </li> 
 <li> Data handling and analytics (small or big data) </li> <li> 
 Programming languages\, e.g.\, Python\, Julia\, R </li> <li> Programming 
 stylistics </li> <li> Using artificial intelligence </li> <li> Training 
 human resources in programming in DHs </li> </ul>

SUMMARY:Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) Ecosystem
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1305
DESCRIPTION:<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p> <p>The Vienna Ab-initio 
 Simulation Package (VASP) is one of the leading electronic structure 
 software to study chemical / physical properties and reactions paths of 
 solids\, surfaces\, and interfaces. It is based on the atomic scale 
 modeling from first principles by solving the many-body Schrödinger-type 
 equation\, the Kohn-Sham equations (Density Functional Theory\; DFT). The 
 software is able to tackle problems with 1-1000s atoms and applications 
 are widely used to perform simulations of liquids\, crystals\, magnetism\,
  semiconductor/insulators\, surfaces\, catalysts.</p> <p>The software has 
 been developed/refractored by the Kresse group at the University of Vienna
  and VASP Software GmbH for about ~25 years. It enables MPI and Open MP 
 parallelism\, and prior to 2011\, first efforts on GPU acceleration with 
 CUDA C were considered.</p> <p>During the meeting considerations on how to
  run VASP efficiently in national HPC facilities (i.e. Oblivion) will be 
 presented. Theoretical background on the underlying theory is to be 
 presented by invited speakers\, and who will also focus on the best 
 practices for running VASP calculations. </p> <p><strong>Scientific 
 Topics</strong></p> <ul> <li>(TD)DFT calculations to probe electronic and 
 optical properties.</li> <li>Vibrational properties to analyse dynamical 
 properties and/or transition states.</li> <li>Going beyond the density-
 functional framework with Many-body Perturbation Theory\, i.e.\, GW 
 approximation.</li> <li>Application of machine learning force fields as 
 opposed to Ab-initio methods.</li> <li>Empirical and/or Ab-initio 
 Molecular Dynamics.</li> </ul>
