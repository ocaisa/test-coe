SUMMARY:YALES2 Training Session
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1322
DESCRIPTION:<p>YALES2 aims at the solving of two-phase combustion from 
 primary atomization to pollutant prediction on massive complex meshes. It 
 is able to handle efficiently unstructured meshes with several billions of
  elements\, thus enabling the Direct Numerical Simulation and Large-Eddy 
 Simulation of laboratory and semi-industrial configurations. The recent 
 developments are focused on the dynamic mesh adaptation of tetrahedral-
 based massive meshes for fronts and interfaces.</p> <p>This training 
 session targets researchers and engineers interested in learning YALES2 
 and/or the numerical methodologies developed in YALES2: solving for 
 incompressible turbulent flows\, two-phase flows\, dynamic mesh 
 adaptation\, etc.</p> <p>More information about YALES2 can be found 
 <strong><a href="https://www.coria-
 cfd.fr/index.php/YALES2">here</a></strong>.</p> 
 <p><strong>Instructors:</strong> Vincent Moureau (CNRS)\, Ghislain 
 Lartigue (CNRS)\, Pierre Bénard (INSA of Rouen)</p>

SUMMARY:Numerical Methods for Large Eddy Simulation
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1323
DESCRIPTION:<p>The objective of the training is twofold: firstly\, to 
 understand the fundamental principles of Large-Scale Simulations for 
 compressive reactive two-phase flows: numerical methods\, boundary 
 conditions\, LES approach and closure models for LES\, combustion as well 
 as two-phase flows through theoretical courses\; on the other hand\, to 
 learn how to use the AVBP code (Last version V7.10) on the perimeter of 
 two-phase reactive flows through tutorials supervised by experts of the 
 code. The AVBP code is a parallel code of fluid mechanics that solves 
 compressible Navier-Stokes equations for laminar and turbulent reactive 
 flows\, in 2D and 3D\, on unstructured and hybrid meshes\, with third 
 order Taylor Galerkin schemes. The resolution of these equations is based 
 on the Large Eddy Simulation (or Large Eddy Simulation) approach. Reduced 
 chemical kinetics according to the Arrhenius law coupled to the TFLES 
 model for sub-grid flame-turbulence interactions make possible to treat 
 combustion phenomena. AVBP can also calculate two-phase flows using a 
 Lagrangian or Eulerian solver. AVBP applies to aeronautical combustion 
 chambers\, turbomachinery\, industrial furnaces and safety issues\, it 
 allows for example to evaluate polluting emissions (CO\, NOx and soot)\, 
 to treat thermo-acoustic instabilities or detonation phenomena. AVBP is a 
 world-famous code in the field of combustion\, used by many laboratories 
 (IMFT in Toulouse\, EM2C in Centralesupelec\, TU Munich\, Von Karmann 
 Institute\, ETH Zurich\, etc.) and in industry (SAFRAN AIRCRAFT ENGINES\, 
 SAFRAN HELICOPTER ENGINES\, ARIANEGROUP\, HERAKLES\, TOTAL\, etc.).</p>
