SUMMARY:MaX school: Ab-initio Many-Body Methods and Simulations with the 
 Yambo Code
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1318
DESCRIPTION:<p>The Computational School on <em>Ab-initio Many-body Methods 
 and Simulations with the Yambo Code</em> will introduce many-body 
 perturbation theory (MBPT) approaches and specifically to<em> first-
 principles</em> excited-state simulations using the YAMBO code.</p> <p>The
  target participants are graduate students\, postdocs\, and researchers 
 who are interested in learning or in improving their knowledge and skills 
 to calculate electronic and optical properties of materials\, beyond the 
 well-known DFT limitations and using an efficient\, highly parallelized 
 and accurate many-body computational tool.</p> <p>Both theoretical and 
 technical lectures will be offered as well as dedicated hands-on sessions 
 where students will learn how to use the code for materials of current 
 research interest and how to optimize its use in a parallel environment. 
 Several post-processing tools for the analysis of the results will be also
  introduced and practically applied.</p> <p>General topics will include 
 self-energy and quasiparticles concepts\, the GW approximation\, and the 
 Bethe-Salpeter equation\, all placed in the context of and linked with 
 experimental measurements (photoemission\, absorption\, 
 photoluminescence).</p> <p>At variance with previous editions\, this 
 school will present some advanced lectures such as:</p> <p>new algorithms 
 developed to deal with electron-phonon interactions\, real time evolution 
 of equations of motion\, time dependent polarization in terms of the Berry
  phase\, and computation of non-linear optical properties.</p> <p>The 
 specific usage in massively parallel environments equipped with modern 
 accelerated video cards (GPU’s) will be introduced.</p> <p> 
 <strong>Participants are required to have a pre-existing background in DFT
  and in running DFT simulations.</strong><br>

 applied mathematics\, and renown scientists in the field of chemistry and 
 physics\, to discuss about the present and future of machine learning for 
 materials.</p> <p>The workshop is free of charge\, and consists of 4 half-
 days of introductory school (Monday to Wednesday)\, followed by 4 half-
 days of conference (Wednesday to Friday). Participants can choose whether 
 to attend both\, or only the conference.</p> <p>A complete timetable of 
 the event will be announced in the following weeks.</p> <p>For further
