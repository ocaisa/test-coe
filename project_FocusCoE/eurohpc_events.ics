SUMMARY:YALES2 Training Session
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1322
DESCRIPTION:<p>YALES2 aims at the solving of two-phase combustion from 
 primary atomization to pollutant prediction on massive complex meshes. It 
 is able to handle efficiently unstructured meshes with several billions of
  elements\, thus enabling the Direct Numerical Simulation and Large-Eddy 
 Simulation of laboratory and semi-industrial configurations. The recent 
 developments are focused on the dynamic mesh adaptation of tetrahedral-
 based massive meshes for fronts and interfaces.</p> <p>This training 
 session targets researchers and engineers interested in learning YALES2 
 and/or the numerical methodologies developed in YALES2: solving for 
 incompressible turbulent flows\, two-phase flows\, dynamic mesh 
 adaptation\, etc.</p> <p>More information about YALES2 can be found 
 <strong><a href="https://www.coria-
 cfd.fr/index.php/YALES2">here</a></strong>.</p>

SUMMARY:MaX school: Ab-initio Many-Body Methods and Simulations with the 
 Yambo Code
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1318
DESCRIPTION:<p>The Computational School on <em>Ab-initio Many-body Methods 
 and Simulations with the Yambo Code</em> will introduce many-body 
 perturbation theory (MBPT) approaches and specifically to<em> first-
 principles</em> excited-state simulations using the YAMBO code.</p> <p>The
  target participants are graduate students\, postdocs\, and researchers 
 who are interested in learning or in improving their knowledge and skills 
 to calculate electronic and optical properties of materials\, beyond the 
 well-known DFT limitations and using an efficient\, highly parallelized 
 and accurate many-body computational tool.</p> <p>Both theoretical and 
 technical lectures will be offered as well as dedicated hands-on sessions 
 where students will learn how to use the code for materials of current 
 research interest and how to optimize its use in a parallel environment. 
 Several post-processing tools for the analysis of the results will be also
  introduced and practically applied.</p> <p>General topics will include 
 self-energy and quasiparticles concepts\, the GW approximation\, and the 
 Bethe-Salpeter equation\, all placed in the context of and linked with 
 experimental measurements (photoemission\, absorption\, 
 photoluminescence).</p> <p>At variance with previous editions\, this 
 school will present some advanced lectures such as:</p> <p>new algorithms 
 developed to deal with electron-phonon interactions\, real time evolution 
 of equations of motion\, time dependent polarization in terms of the Berry
  phase\, and computation of non-linear optical properties.</p> <p>The 
 specific usage in massively parallel environments equipped with modern 
 accelerated video cards (GPU’s) will be introduced.</p> <p>

SUMMARY:Numerical Methods for Large Eddy Simulation
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1323
DESCRIPTION:<p>The objective of the training is twofold: firstly\, to 
 understand the fundamental principles of Large-Scale Simulations for 
 compressive reactive two-phase flows: numerical methods\, boundary 
 conditions\, LES approach and closure models for LES\, combustion as well 
 as two-phase flows through theoretical courses\; on the other hand\, to 
 learn how to use the AVBP code (Last version V7.10) on the perimeter of 
 two-phase reactive flows through tutorials supervised by experts of the 
 code. The AVBP code is a parallel code of fluid mechanics that solves 
 compressible Navier-Stokes equations for laminar and turbulent reactive 
 flows\, in 2D and 3D\, on unstructured and hybrid meshes\, with third 
 order Taylor Galerkin schemes. The resolution of these equations is based 
 on the Large Eddy Simulation (or Large Eddy Simulation) approach. Reduced 
 chemical kinetics according to the Arrhenius law coupled to the TFLES 
 model for sub-grid flame-turbulence interactions make possible to treat 
 combustion phenomena. AVBP can also calculate two-phase flows using a 
 Lagrangian or Eulerian solver. AVBP applies to aeronautical combustion 
 chambers\, turbomachinery\, industrial furnaces and safety issues\, it 
 allows for example to evaluate polluting emissions (CO\, NOx and soot)\, 
 to treat thermo-acoustic instabilities or detonation phenomena. AVBP is a 
 world-famous code in the field of combustion\, used by many laboratories 
 (IMFT in Toulouse\, EM2C in Centralesupelec\, TU Munich\, Von Karmann 
 Institute\, ETH Zurich\, etc.) and in industry (SAFRAN AIRCRAFT ENGINES\, 
 SAFRAN HELICOPTER ENGINES\, ARIANEGROUP\, HERAKLES\, TOTAL\, etc.).</p>

SUMMARY:NOMAD&#039\;s Midsummer School: Towards exascale solutions in Green
  function methods and advanced DFT
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1325
DESCRIPTION:<p>With 10^18 floating point operations per second\, exascale 
 computers will be able to simulate and analyze complex processes in real 
 materials more realistically than what is possible today. This will allow 
 to study systems of higher complexity (in space and time) and to achieve 
 higher accuracy and precision. In close contact with academia and 
 industry\, the <strong>NOMAD CoE</strong> will develop exascale software\,
  artificial intelligence (Al) methods\, and efficient workflows for an 
 advanced materials modeling. The <strong>NOMAD School focusses on 
 "exascale solutions in Green function methods and advanced 
 DFT"</strong>.</p> <p> The NOMAD School features <strong>50-minute 
 tutorial lectures </strong>by renowned scientists of the field (see below 
 and the PROGRAM) who will introduce their respective topics and address 
 recent exascale achievements and prevailing challenges.</p> <p> NOMAD 
 anticipates that the exascale challenge\, which shows "exaflops" 
 performance in some components of the codes\, will be met by workflows 
 handling high-throughput calculations and/or complex ensemble averages of 
 statistical mechanics and artificial intelligence. To get more practical 
 insights into all these topics\, there will be hands-on tutorials and/or 
 hackathons in the afternoon\, run in parallel by key developers of the 
 codes Abinit\, exciting\, FHI-aims\, <strong>GPAW</strong>\, and by 
 <strong>developers of ASE/ASR\, CC4S and Mini-Apps</strong>. For 
 example:</p> <ul> <li>people presently using code A can learn about the 
 possible advantages of code B.</li> <li>people using any of the codes can 
 learn about and contribute to the workflow management of ASE/AS R.</li> 
 <li>people using any of the codes can learn about and contribute to the 
 development of the INTERFACE towards CC4S (coupled cluster for 
 solids).</li> <li>people using any of the codes can learn about and 
 contribute to the development of mini apps to check and analyze their code
  performance.</li> </ul> <p>The school is aimed at graduate students and 
 early-career postdocs. </p>
