SUMMARY:BioExcel Summer School on Biomolecular Simulations 2022
UID:https://hpc-portal.eu/node/1316
DESCRIPTION:<p>The summer school will include lectures and hands-on 
 sessions on the following topics:</p> <ul> <li>Molecular dynamics 
 simulations</li> <li>Biomolecular docking</li> <li>Free energy 
 calculations</li> <li>Advanced sampling methods (Metadynamics)</li> 
 <li>BioExcel Building Blocks (BioBB)</li> <li>Quantum mechanics/molecular 
 mechanics (QM/MM)</li> <li>Machine learning</li> </ul> <p>During the 
 hands-on computer practicals you will make use of the BioExcel flagship 
 software and tools: e.g. GROMACS\, HADDOCK\, PMX\, BioBB\, and CP2K. The 
 trainers\, developers and/or experts in the use of the software\, will 
 provide guidance and support.</p> <p><strong>Audience and 
 Prerequisites</strong></p> <p>The BioExcel school is intended for 
 primarily PhD and post-doctoral researchers using or planning to use 
 biomolecular modeling and simulation in their everyday research. 
 Familiarity with Linux and basic knowledge of molecular modelling software
  is a requirement.</p>
